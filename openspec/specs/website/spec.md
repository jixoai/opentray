# website Specification

## Purpose
The official static site presenting OpenTray to the public: positioning,
features, quick start, and ecosystem links, in the shared jixoai identity.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Static official site in the jixoai identity

The site SHALL be a SvelteKit adapter-static build whose entire visual
identity comes from the `@jixoai` registry (jixoai-theme token sheet with
`--brand-hue: 222`, registry site chrome), differing from sibling jixoai
sites in hue and content only.

#### Scenario: registry lock governs the chrome

- **WHEN** the site package is built after `npx jixoai-ui upgrade`
- **THEN** every locked component refreshes from the registry and the build
  still passes, with no hand-edited registry files.

#### Scenario: dark mode

- **WHEN** the theme is toggled to dark
- **THEN** the background is pure black, borders/shadows invert, the primary
  drifts to the dark-mode variant, and no flash precedes first paint.

### Requirement: GitHub Pages delivery with deferred custom domain

The site SHALL deploy to GitHub Pages from a workflow, serving from the
project pages path until the Owner configures DNS, and SHALL support both
root and subpath serving from one build configuration.

#### Scenario: subpath serving before DNS

- **WHEN** the site is built without the CNAME flag
- **THEN** all internal links and assets resolve under the `/opentray` base
  path and the deployed pages return 200.

#### Scenario: custom domain cutover

- **WHEN** the Owner sets DNS and the workflow builds with the CNAME flag
- **THEN** the build writes the CNAME file and serves from the domain root
  with no code change beyond the flag.

### Requirement: AI export layer

The site SHALL ship `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and per-page `.md` mirrors
generated at build time from one generation point, with absolute URLs.

#### Scenario: regeneration is stable

- **WHEN** the build runs twice without content changes
- **THEN** the exported files are byte-identical.

### Requirement: Bilingual locale surface (en/zh)

The site SHALL serve English at the root (stable URLs) and a full Chinese
mirror at `/zh/`, with per-locale `<html lang>`, hreflang alternates, a
visible language switcher, and locale-covered AI export.

#### Scenario: zh mirror

- **WHEN** `/zh/` is requested (built under any SITE_BASE)
- **THEN** the page renders with Chinese copy sourced from README-zh.md,
  `lang="zh"`, and hreflang links for en, zh, and x-default.

#### Scenario: switching locales

- **WHEN** the language switcher is used
- **THEN** navigation stays on the corresponding page of the other locale.

### Requirement: Purpose-led bilingual copy

The site copy SHALL lead with the problem the project exists to solve
(sourced from the repo's intent documents), in both locales, with every
claim traceable to README/openspec/AGENTS sources — feature inventories
without motivation are rejected.

#### Scenario: hero narrates purpose

- **WHEN** the home page renders in either locale
- **THEN** the hero states what problem OpenTray solves for CLI/AI-skill
  authors before listing capabilities, and each feature section carries
  a motivation sentence.

### Requirement: Browser language negotiation on the default surface

Default-locale pages SHALL negotiate the visitor language before first
paint: an explicit persisted choice wins; otherwise the first
navigator.languages match among available locales redirects once to the
same page under its locale prefix. Non-default pages never redirect.

#### Scenario: zh browser lands on zh

- **WHEN** a browser with zh preference loads the default-locale page
- **THEN** it is redirected (path + hash preserved) to the `/zh/`
  mirror before content paints.

#### Scenario: explicit choice beats detection

- **WHEN** the visitor has persisted a language choice via the switcher
- **THEN** no detection redirect occurs.
