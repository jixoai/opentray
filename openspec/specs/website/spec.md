# website Specification

## Purpose
The official static site presenting OpenTray to the public: positioning,
features, quick start, and ecosystem links, in the shared jixoai identity.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Static official site in the jixoai identity

The site SHALL be a SvelteKit adapter-static build whose entire visual
identity comes from the `@jixoai` registry (jixoai-theme token sheet with
`--brand-hue: 222`, registry site chrome), differing from sibling jixoai
sites in hue and content only.

#### Scenario: registry lock governs the chrome

- **WHEN** the site package is built after `npx jixoai-ui upgrade`
- **THEN** every locked component refreshes from the registry and the build
  still passes, with no hand-edited registry files.

#### Scenario: dark mode

- **WHEN** the theme is toggled to dark
- **THEN** the background is pure black, borders/shadows invert, the primary
  drifts to the dark-mode variant, and no flash precedes first paint.

### Requirement: GitHub Pages delivery with deferred custom domain

The site SHALL deploy to GitHub Pages from a workflow, serving from the
project pages path until the Owner configures DNS, and SHALL support both
root and subpath serving from one build configuration.

#### Scenario: subpath serving before DNS

- **WHEN** the site is built without the CNAME flag
- **THEN** all internal links and assets resolve under the `/opentray` base
  path and the deployed pages return 200.

#### Scenario: custom domain cutover

- **WHEN** the Owner sets DNS and the workflow builds with the CNAME flag
- **THEN** the build writes the CNAME file and serves from the domain root
  with no code change beyond the flag.

### Requirement: AI export layer

The site SHALL ship `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and per-page `.md` mirrors
generated at build time from one generation point, with absolute URLs.

#### Scenario: regeneration is stable

- **WHEN** the build runs twice without content changes
- **THEN** the exported files are byte-identical.
